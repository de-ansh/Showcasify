# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for the Showcasify project.

## Environment Variables

- **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
  - These files contain sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys
  - The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude these files

- **Use `.env.example` as a template**
  - Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file
  - Do not include actual secrets or credentials in `.env.example`

## Database Credentials

- For local development, the default PostgreSQL credentials are:
  - Username: `postgres`
  - Password: `postgres`
  - Database: `showcasify`
  - These are fine for local development but **should never be used in production**

- For production:
  - Use strong, randomly generated passwords
  - Consider using environment-specific credentials
  - Use secret management services when possible

## API Secrets

- When implementing authentication:
  - Generate a strong, unique SECRET_KEY
  - Set appropriate token expiration times
  - Store secrets securely using environment variables

## Docker Security

- Never expose the PostgreSQL port (5432) directly to the internet
- Use non-root users inside containers when possible
- Keep Docker and container images updated

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. Change all default credentials
2. Enable HTTPS with proper TLS/SSL certificates
3. Set up proper firewall and network security rules
4. Implement authentication and authorization for API endpoints
5. Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in your production environment

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting the project maintainers directly rather than opening a public issue.
